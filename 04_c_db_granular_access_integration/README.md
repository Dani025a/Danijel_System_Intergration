Troubleshooting Setup Issues in Ubuntu Environment

It appears there's a lack of information regarding the necessity of running the process in Ubuntu, as sudo is being employed. Initially, I attempted to execute the commands in a Windows environment and encountered the following errors.

For individuals already operating within Ubuntu, it might be relatively straightforward to execute the process. However, I'm currently utilizing Windows and lack familiarity with Ubuntu workflows. I attempted to run the process within a virtual machine running Ubuntu, encountering a couple of errors.

The first and second commands executed successfully. However, upon attempting bash /home/db-setup/setup.sh or psql -U rwuser -d postgres, errors surfaced.
